## 2026-06-04 — Phase 1: Theme + Splash + Onboarding

### What was built
- Full dark theme system (AppColors + AppTheme) with zinc-950 background, orange accent, Poppins headings, Inter body
- go_router with /splash → /onboarding → /home routes
- ProviderScope + Supabase.initialize wired in main.dart
- Splash screen: animated fade-in wordmark, grid CustomPainter overlay, 2.5s auto-navigate
- Onboarding: 3-page PageView (Level / Goal / Challenge) with animated pill selectors and dot indicators
- Home screen: 4-tab BottomNavigationBar placeholder (Home / Learn / Challenges / Profile)

### Files touched
- pubspec.yaml (added flutter_riverpod, go_router, google_fonts, supabase_flutter)
- lib/main.dart
- lib/core/theme/app_colors.dart
- lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart
- lib/core/router/app_router.dart
- lib/features/auth/screens/splash_screen.dart
- lib/features/auth/screens/onboarding_screen.dart
- lib/features/content/screens/home_screen.dart
- test/widget_test.dart (replaced stale counter test)

### Decisions
- Used `publishableKey` instead of deprecated `anonKey` in Supabase.initialize
- Unselected onboarding pills keep orange 1px border (matches the brand energy even when inactive)
- Grid painter uses `withValues(alpha:)` (null-safe modern API) instead of deprecated `withOpacity`

## 2026-06-04 — Phase 2: Supabase Auth

### What was built
- SupabaseService: static client getter wrapping Supabase.instance.client
- AuthRepository: signIn / signUp / signOut / getCurrentUser with AuthException handling
- authRepositoryProvider + authStateProvider (StreamProvider on onAuthStateChange)
- AuthGateScreen: watches auth state, redirects to /home or /login
- LoginScreen: email + password fields, sign-in CTA, forgot password, "create account" outlined button, loading + error states
- SignupScreen: name + email + password fields, create account CTA, terms text, back arrow
- Router updated: /auth-gate, /login, /signup routes added
- Splash now navigates to /auth-gate (not /onboarding) — returning users skip onboarding
- Onboarding "LET'S GO" navigates to /login instead of /home

### Files touched
- lib/core/services/supabase_service.dart (new)
- lib/features/auth/repository/auth_repository.dart (new)
- lib/features/auth/providers/auth_provider.dart (new)
- lib/features/auth/screens/auth_gate.dart (new)
- lib/features/auth/screens/login_screen.dart (new)
- lib/features/auth/screens/signup_screen.dart (new)
- lib/core/router/app_router.dart (updated)
- lib/features/auth/screens/splash_screen.dart (updated nav target)
- lib/features/auth/screens/onboarding_screen.dart (updated nav target)
- CLAUDE.md (Phase 2 checked off)

### Gotchas
- supabase_flutter v2 uses onAuthStateChange stream returning AuthState objects; session != null means signed in
- AuthGate uses ref.listen (not ref.watch) for navigation side-effects — avoids calling context.go during build

## 2026-06-04 — Phase 3: Home screen + Content library

### What was built
- Tutorial model with fromJson/toJson
- 6 mock tutorials (placeholder @samsjump YouTube IDs — replace when verified)
- ContentRepository: getTutorials / getTutorialsByLevel / getTutorialById (mock data, Supabase-ready)
- Riverpod providers: tutorialsProvider, tutorialsByLevelProvider, tutorialByIdProvider (family)
- TutorialCard widget: 200px wide, YouTube thumbnail via cached_network_image, level badge, duration badge, tap → /tutorial/:id
- HomeScreen rebuilt: greeting header, featured challenge card, "Free Tutorials" horizontal scroll, "Your Level" filtered scroll, IndexedStack for tab persistence
- TutorialDetailScreen: YoutubePlayerBuilder + YoutubePlayer, back arrow overlay, badges, description, "More Like This" related cards
- Router: /tutorial/:id route added
- AppColors: levelBeginner / levelIntermediate / levelAdvanced added

### Files touched
- pubspec.yaml (added youtube_player_flutter, cached_network_image)
- lib/core/theme/app_colors.dart
- lib/core/router/app_router.dart
- lib/features/content/models/tutorial.dart (new)
- lib/features/content/data/mock_tutorials.dart (new)
- lib/features/content/repository/content_repository.dart (new)
- lib/features/content/providers/content_provider.dart (new)
- lib/features/content/widgets/tutorial_card.dart (new)
- lib/features/content/screens/home_screen.dart (rewritten)
- lib/features/content/screens/tutorial_detail_screen.dart (new)
- CLAUDE.md

### Gotchas
- youtube_player_flutter uses flutter_inappwebview which prints a Swift Package Manager warning on iOS — not an error, safe to ignore until plugin updates
- Video playback works on Android/iOS only; web shows a blank player area
- Mock YouTube IDs are placeholders — user should replace with real @samsjump video IDs
- Dart 3 wildcard `_` can be repeated in param lists; `(_, __)` → `(_, _)` to satisfy unnecessary_underscores lint
