## 2026-06-04 — Phase 1: Theme + Splash + Onboarding

### What was built
- Full dark theme system (AppColors + AppTheme) with zinc-950 background, orange accent, Poppins headings, Inter body
- go_router with /splash → /onboarding → /home routes
- ProviderScope + Supabase.initialize wired in main.dart
- Splash screen: animated fade-in wordmark, grid CustomPainter overlay, 2.5s auto-navigate
- Onboarding: 3-page PageView (Level / Goal / Challenge) with animated pill selectors and dot indicators
- Home screen: 4-tab BottomNavigationBar placeholder (Home / Learn / Challenges / Profile)

### Files touched
- pubspec.yaml (added flutter_riverpod, go_router, google_fonts, supabase_flutter)
- lib/main.dart
- lib/core/theme/app_colors.dart
- lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart
- lib/core/router/app_router.dart
- lib/features/auth/screens/splash_screen.dart
- lib/features/auth/screens/onboarding_screen.dart
- lib/features/content/screens/home_screen.dart
- test/widget_test.dart (replaced stale counter test)

### Decisions
- Used `publishableKey` instead of deprecated `anonKey` in Supabase.initialize
- Unselected onboarding pills keep orange 1px border (matches the brand energy even when inactive)
- Grid painter uses `withValues(alpha:)` (null-safe modern API) instead of deprecated `withOpacity`
